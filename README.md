# Final_project_DSBA_5122_Han_Zhang

This is a project to visualize Level 2 and DC Fast EV charging station data across the United States.

Dataset comes from here https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC

I hope this app will help more people get to know the distribution of charging stations by state and city, so they can plan their routes early and ease their mileage anxiety.

App deployed here https://zybreo-final-project-dsba-5122-han-zhang-final-pj-qhfzwy.streamlit.app/
